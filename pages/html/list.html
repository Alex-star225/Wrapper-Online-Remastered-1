I have disabled the uploads right now to stop this criticism and spamming lots of MBs on my hard drive, you don't ever scheme this seriously. Also it's my HHD is TOSHIBA MQ01ABD050V -63 in the outside of ASUS-X52J laptop. If you try seriously to hack my hard drive to delete System32, I had to mind to upgrade Windows 10 into 64-bit architecture operating system and reinstall over again like Tomas Marciulaitis even did by Microsoft Tech Support by giving him a ransomware, may you brainwash and stop thinking about to me things I can do anything we want. Your repetition is not a life, do things like Fleeing the Complex, Puyo Puyo Tetris, SM3DAS, Among Us or you still play Roblox on this game, not this illegal of the maker is deserve to be patched. It's unpatchable right? You are not your boss, I can ban your accounts then IP banned to the team would like to ban you and strike you for some dumb reasons, you can appeal and say sorry for dozens of times and apology is not accepted anymore, just great and your apology is not gonna to accept at all of the time, your apology is not enough for this. You have no idea that you beg others like: PLEAZ UNBAN ME PLS PLS I AM SORRY I WILL NOT DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT I AM SORRY PLEASE I AM SORRY ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES PLS!!!! I CAN DO ANYTHING WE LIKE IT. MY SOCIAL MEDIA ISN'T MY WRONG WAY, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHIN FOR DECISION OF YOUR STATEMENT. YOUR IMPLEMENT, PLEASE!. Team says: You have no idea to talk and beg for unbanning me and say sorry isn't just be possible. Check your language and clean up your grammar first, it's extremely bad. Denied. | Always was denied. You can't appeal for next time. If you appeal with bad words, then you may get your account banned or suspended. | Beggar says: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I AM FUCKING BANNED I HAVE TO CREAT MY FUCKING NEW ACCOUNT! *types new account and creates him then email verification then profit* YAY I CREATED THE FUCKIN ACCOUNT NOBODY CAN BAN ME AND FIND ME BITCHES HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Team: Hello, BEGGAR IS BACK! We inform you that you are not allowed to enter the Twitter and I have IP banned for you, have a nice day. Thank you very much. If this mistake, no decisions, worries will still there, sorry is goodbye for your website. Say your prayers and say goodbye all you want, whenever you want to do that. I see your account was created before I banned you then. Get your life and farm over one year and leave-out of the internet connectivity and suck your life and go fuck urself of your life. Jesus christ, I have no other words that you will say to me, you being too psychopathic person in the world. I am going to send your account posts and the people will laugh at you, then you are so freaking bitch. Nobody cares. You can't go away of this website, I can ban and find your ISP to ban you newly. You don't have a assignment. | Gone for newest accounts being banned for new account creation. Before that, ISP banned example of this ugly person and fat takis person in the United states. Get your heinz and poop your tomatoes down. ISP banned this ugly person and unable to connect the internet because he is so retarded and hatred. Thanks for your surveillance and your accommodations.">UPLOAD</a>
